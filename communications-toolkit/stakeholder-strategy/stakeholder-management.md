# Stakeholder Management

## General Procedures

The following procedures shall ensure appropriate consideration and management of relevant stakeholders:

1. Define all stakeholders that are relevant to your organization \
   (Reference: [stakeholder-overview.md](stakeholder-overview.md "mention"))
2. Define all channels that you intend to use for engagement with your stakeholders \
   (Reference: [ecosystem-touchpoints.md](ecosystem-touchpoints.md "mention"))
3. Perform a stakeholder mapping and define your individual ways of engagement with the different stakeholder groups (Reference: [#stakeholder-map](stakeholder-management.md#stakeholder-map "mention"))
4. Document all defined stakeholders with the respective management measures in the stakeholder register (Reference: [#stakeholder-register](stakeholder-management.md#stakeholder-register "mention")). Also take best practices covering incident communication into account (Reference: [incident-communication-protocols.md](../incident-communication-protocols.md "mention")).
5. Define appropriate intervals to review accuracy and relevance of documented contents in the stakeholder register

## Stakeholder Map

The **Stakeholder Map** provides guidance when categorizing the individual stakeholders into different communication groups. It can be used as an initial assessment for further review and adaption to your individual stakeholder landscape.

Only use the Communication Map below as a reference! Review each your stakeholder individually and assess needed means of contact! You can find the template here: [stakeholder-map.md](../templates-and-toolkits/stakeholder-map.md "mention")
