# Stakeholder Strategy

The Stakeholder Strategy outlines relevant information around general communication within the stakeholder landscape of Node Operators.&#x20;

The [stakeholder-overview.md](stakeholder-overview.md "mention") aims to provide transparency to the main entities and individuals to consider in your overall communication setup.&#x20;

In [ecosystem-touchpoints.md](ecosystem-touchpoints.md "mention") you can find an overview about communication channels and how they are commonly used to engage with different stakeholders.&#x20;

The final section [stakeholder-management.md](stakeholder-management.md "mention") takes the previous sections into account by providing a reference stakeholder map and introduces processes to document your stakeholder landscape properly.
