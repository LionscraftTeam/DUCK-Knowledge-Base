### Planned Solutions&#x20;

_Content_

#### Content Updates

Working in public view in GitHub, based on feedback received we will propose updates on a continuous basis. These will be made to a defined branch - currently the "V2 Branch". Stable versions for reference will be published every 6-18 months, and will reflect the latest accepted updates at the time they are prepared. Those versions may receive minor editorial cleaning, such as updates to their status (in particular when they are superseded by a newer stable version), or typos and markup corrections, but their technical content will not be chagend after publication.

Updates are proposed as Pull Requests, based on Issues raised. They will be assigned a Milestone that corresponds to a bi-weekly meeting, allowing the community to comment asynchronously on each proposal before any decision is made to accept it.

* **Single-page Specification** - We aim to produce a single-page specification that can easily be downloaded, printed etc.
* **Rationalisation** - Where there are currently multiple risks covering the same problem, we aim to consolidate them for easier reference
* **Checklists** ‚Äì Create easy-to-use checklists that combine risks, mitigations, and controls for specific node operator maturity levels
* **Historic Slashing Overview** ‚Äì Link historic slashing causes to mitigations, highlighting prevention measures

#### Features

* **Self-sustaining Governance** ‚Äì Transition to new governance mechanisms to make the initiative more community-driven
* **GitPOAPs** - Specific POAPs for contributors & supporters of D.U.C.K.
* **Badges** ‚Äì Certification badges for node operators using D.U.C.K.

#### Outreach

* **Integration & Collaboration** ‚Äì Integrate D.U.C.K. into existing research/education programs of initiatives/protocols/foundations
* **Community Growth** ‚Äì Grow the  ‚ÄúDUCK Community‚Äù to become the largest node operator community for risk-related exchange
* **Marketing Campaigns** ‚Äì Run marketing campaigns with Node operators and communities
