# ℹ️ Structure Overview

## Introduction

D.U.C.K. is introducing 3 layers of critical knowledge and information to the Node Operator community with risks at center of it. The **D.U.C.K. Components Overview** shall provide a simple understanding of the knowledge captured within this knowledge base.

## Risk Framework

The core of the D.U.C.K. knowledge base are risks. This includes all risks Node Operators are exposed to, whether it's infrastructure, people, software or other risks leading to negative impact on the Node Operator business or ecosystem.

The [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") aims to capture relevant risks that Node Operators are exposed to. The framework provides a structure and insights into critical risks and related sub-risks.

Key sections are:

* [risks](../risk-framework/risks/ "mention") - Collection of major risks relevant to Node Operators
* [risk-assessment-procedures.md](../risk-framework/risk-assessment-procedures.md "mention") - Information regarding procedures to assess the impact of identified risks
* [risk-management-procedures.md](../risk-framework/risk-management-procedures.md "mention") - Guidance on procedures to manage identified risks and potential impacts
* [review-and-audit-procedures.md](../risk-framework/review-and-audit-procedures.md "mention") - Best practices around review & auditing of risks management processes in place
* [risk-register.md](../risk-framework/templates/risk-register.md "mention") - Documentation template for all risks, mitigations & controls

## Mitigation & Controls

Based on the identified risks and sub-risks, the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") equips Node Operators with [mitigation-strategies.md](../mitigation-and-controls-library/mitigation-strategies.md "mention") and a [controls-catalog-and-best-practices.md](../mitigation-and-controls-library/controls-catalog-and-best-practices.md "mention") to address the identified risk landscape adequately.&#x20;

Key sections are:

* [mitigation-strategies.md](../mitigation-and-controls-library/mitigation-strategies.md "mention") - Mitigation strategies & best practices addressing the identified risks
* [controls-catalog-and-best-practices.md](../mitigation-and-controls-library/controls-catalog-and-best-practices.md "mention") - Reference of relevant Controls standards
* [implementation-guidelines.md](../mitigation-and-controls-library/implementation-guidelines.md "mention") - Infrastructure and Monitoring implementation guidelines
* [collection-of-tools-scripts-and-templates.md](../mitigation-and-controls-library/collection-of-tools-scripts-and-templates.md "mention") - Relevant Tools and references&#x20;

## Communication Toolkit

The [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") as the outer layer of D.U.C.K. provides information and material for Node Operators to consider for their communication with their stakeholder landscape, especially in the case of risks becoming incidents despite mitigation & control measures in place.

Key sections are:

* [stakeholder-strategy](../communications-toolkit/stakeholder-strategy/ "mention") - Overview of stakeholders, communication channels, and stakeholder management
* [incident-communication-protocols.md](../communications-toolkit/incident-communication-protocols.md "mention") - Communication best practices pre-, during, and -post incidents
* [templates-and-toolkits](../communications-toolkit/templates-and-toolkits/ "mention") - Communication templates, tools, and documents
* [ecosystem-blueprint](../communications-toolkit/ecosystem-blueprint/ "mention") - Examples of Node Operator communication setups
