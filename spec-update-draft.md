# DUCK

## Abstract

This specification defines a series of risks that can apply when operating a blockchain node.
It provides a series of mitigations that can minimise the likelihood that particular risks will be realised and cause a problem,
such as compromising the control of a node or actions that result in reduced economic rewards, or penalties such as slashing.



## Risks

The six core risk categories specific to node operations define overarching
dimensions that Node Operators should consider in their overall setup.


### Slashing Risks:

Performing slashable actions leading to penalties.

# Risk Management Procedures

Processes and actions that should be defined to address risks and that cover the concrete procedures in case of related incidents. &#x20;

## 1.  Incident Response Plan

Define Incident Response Plans (ICR) for all specific [risks](risks/ "mention") and store them in a central location with access for all relevant employees. ICRs establish plans for managing security incidents and events, and offer guidance for employees or incident responders who believe they have discovered, or are responding to, a security incident. Ensure that relevant employees are aware of the location. Simulations of an Incident Response Plan should be conducted at least once a year.

</div>

## 2. Disaster Recovery Plan

A Disaster Recovery Plan gives guidance on recovering one or more information systems at an alternate facility in response to a major hardware or software failure or destruction of facilities. Simulations of a Disaster Recovery Plan should be conducted at least once a year in a test environment.

## 4. Pre-Mortem

Perform Pre-Mortems for specific risks. The article linked below provides instructions on how to use Pre-Mortems to prevent incidents. Example topics for a Pre-Mortem could be&#x20;

* Unauthorized users could gain access to the servers
* In the case of a security compromise it is not clear what to do
* A specific scenario could result in downtime

# Risk Assessment Procedures

This Risk Assessment Procedure provides a systematic approach for Ethereum
node operators to assess the financial loss and the probability for each
identified scenario.

## **1. Assessment of Financial Loss for Each Identified Scenario**

**Direct Monetary Losses from a Slashing Event**\
Assess the losses directly linked to the slashing event. This can include:

* Direct slashing penalty due to double signing (currently 1 ETH)
* "Correlated slashing penalty" occurs 18 days after the initial slashing
* Slashing leads to validator downtime until the slashed validator is exited
* Missed rewards
* Possible recoveries from insurance payments




**Direct Monetary Losses from a Downtime Event**\
Assess the losses directly from the downtime event. This can include:

* Downtime penalties until the validator is exited
* Missed rewards
* Possible recoveries from insurance payments

**Reputational Risks**\
Determine the monetary loss from reputational damage. This includes:

* Reduction in earnings due to the depletion of presently staked assets
* Loss of anticipated earnings due to the diminishment of future staked assets

**Losses from the Event Investigation**\
Indirect losses can arise from the investigation of the slashing or downtime event. This can include:

* Costs associated with conducting an internal investigation
* Expenses for external investigative services
* Replacement or upgrading of hardware and software

**Legal Disputes and Liabilities**\
Additional costs can come from legal disputes and liabilities. This can include:

* Obligation for slashing or downtime events as stated in Service Level Agreements
* Expenses for legal dispute settlement and court fees to address or defend against liabilities
* Costs associated with legal consultation and advisory services
* Possible insurance payments (e.g. for legal defence costs)

***

## **2. Assessment of the Occurrence Probability for Each Identified Scenario**

Assign a likelihood of occurrence and estimate the potential financial impact for each risk identified. This approach considers the specific operational context of the node operator and requires the node operator to tailor the assessment to its unique risk exposure, and vulnerabilities and to take the mitigation strategies into account. This process can be informed by:

* Analyzing historical data to understand past trends and incidents (external, internal incidents, and near-miss incidents)
* Reviewing industry reports for insights into common risks and their fiscal consequences in similar scenarios
* Consulting with experts in the field to gain a comprehensive perspective on risk probabilities and impacts
* Utilizing risk assessment tools or software for a more data-driven analysis
* Analyze the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR, The average time it takes to fully restore a system or service after a failure or security incident) in case of a downtime under different scenarios.

***

## 3. Risk Matrix

Create a risk matrix to visually categorize risks based on their severity and likelihood. This helps in prioritizing which risks need more immediate attention. This process can be performed before and after the identified mitigation and controls are in place to visualize the effect of these strategies.

# Review & Audit Procedures

## Introduction

This document provides a guide for Ethereum node operators on the best practices for conducting IT security-related reviews and audits. It aims to ensure the security, efficiency, and compliance of the node operations within the Ethereum network.&#x20;

See as well the NIST Technical guidance to Information Security Testing and Assessment : [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf)

## 1. Internal Reviews vs External Audits

#### Internal Reviews:

* **Purpose:** To conduct self-assessments of the node's operation and management
* **Process:** Conducted by the node's operating team using internal checklists and monitoring tools
* **Benefits:** Quick identification and rectification of operational issues and continuous improvement at a low cost

#### External Audits:

* **Purpose:** To provide an independent assessment of the node's operation and compliance
* **Process:** Conducted by third-party experts or audit firms specializing in blockchain technology and IT security
* **Benefits:** Provides credibility, helps in identifying blind spots in internal reviews, and ensures compliance with industry standards

## 2. Types of Audits to be Conducted

#### Infrastructure Audits:

* **Purpose:** To identify vulnerabilities, ensure alignment with best practices, and ensure that the node is secure from internal and external threats
* **Key Areas:** Examples are network access points security, patching, set-up of the failover system, back-up, access management, slashing protection, key management and data encryption

#### Smart Contract Security Audits:

* **Purpose:** To identify vulnerabilities in the smart contracts developed by the node operator
* **Key Areas:** Examples are Smart Contract security audit or deployment audit

#### Compliance Audits:

* **Purpose:** To verify adherence to regulatory requirements and Ethereum network standards
* **Key Areas:** Validate node's alignment with Ethereum's protocol updates and adherence to legal regulations concerning cryptocurrency operations (e.g. OFAC MEV compliance and KYC compliance)

#### Performance Audits:

* **Purpose:** To assess the efficiency and stability of the node
* **Key Areas:** Block propagation time, transaction processing speed, uptime metrics, and resource utilization (such as CPU and memory usage)

## 3. When to Perform Audits

#### Regularly-Scheduled Audits:

* **Frequency:** Conducting audits regularly ensures consistent security. Regular audits are required as security standards change over time and new vulnerabilities and attack vectors are published.
* **Scope:** These audits should encompass all types of audits mentioned under section 2.

#### Event-Triggered Audits:

* **Triggers:** Perform audits in response to specific events such as network upgrades (hard forks), security breaches, updates of the smart contract, compliance events,  performance issues, or major infrastructure updates.
* **Focus:** These audits should primarily assess the impact of the event on your node's operation and security.

## 4. General Suggestions for Internal Audit

#### Responsible Person:

* Assign a dedicated team or individual responsible for conducting and overseeing the audit process.&#x20;
* This role includes planning, executing, and following up on audit findings.

#### Well-defined Checklist:

* **Internal Audit Checklist:** Develop a comprehensive list covering all aspects of node operation, including security, performance, and compliance. This checklist should be regularly updated to reflect changes in technology and regulations. This checklist should be created with input from the internal team and, if possible, checklists from external sources.
* **External Audit Checklist:** For external audits, prepare a list that includes areas for external verification.

#### Documentation Approach:

* Establish a systematic approach for documenting the audit process.&#x20;
* This should include the responsible person, types and dates of audits having been conducted, audit reports, methods used conducting the audit, scope of the audit and audit vendor.&#x20;

#### Documentation of Results:

* Create a structured format for reporting audit results.&#x20;
* This should include detailed findings, recommendations, and any corrective actions taken.&#x20;
* Ensure that these reports are accessible to relevant stakeholders for review and follow-up.

# ℹ️ Mitigation & Controls Library

The Mitigations & Controls Library is a curated repository of information, tools, and best practices designed to address and manage risks inherent to node operations. This comprehensive library serves as a go-to resource for node operators, providing actionable insights and mitigation options to enhance the security, reliability, and efficiency of their operations.

Tangible components:

* Mitigation strategies and Best Practices
* Controls catalog
* Implementation Guides library for selected controls
* Ready-to-use tools, scripts, and templates

Most of the best practices that optimize up-time, access control and general stability directly apply to operating a node properly. However, there are a few risks that are very specific to running a node-operator, and to mitigate them, higher levels of process segregation need to be achieved.

When analyzing the scope and the respective identified risks, we have found the best fit being a combination of control criteria from three frameworks:

* [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
* [ISO 27001](#iso-27001)
* [SOC2](#soc2)

As with every audit, we put together the control criteria which are [material](https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c-00320.pdf) in the context of protecting node operators from their specific risks.

# Mitigation Strategies

## Node-Operator Technology Stack Mitigations

### Local anti-slashing database

To avoid double signing, validators maintain a history of messages they signed, and this is usually stored inside of a database. In some cases, this feature is enabled by an external web3signer. The maintenance and protection of this database is crucial, as inconsistencies in this database may cause a double-signing event. The following items need to be in place:

* Persistence of anti-slashing database: Ensure that a persistent, not a temporary storage is used for the anti-slashing database.
* Ensure that slashing databases are always connected: It is possible to run a validator and a database, but never connect those two. Verify via monitoring that they interact.
* Prevent deletion

</div>

### Doppelgänger protection

While there are multiple measures possible to be taken to avoid two validator running with the same signing keys, one can also employ technologies that detect and prevent two validators running at the same time. This can be done using monitoring and alert systems, robust StatefulSet handling in Kubernetes to ensure no two containers with the same keys run at the same time, or pre-defined tools such as [DoppelBuster](https://github.com/SimplyStaking/DoppelBuster).

<div class="info">

</div>

### Use of a Web3Signer

The main benefit of the use of Web3 signers is to have a service that is focused on the signing task directly, and comes with protection mechanisms.

Similar to the anti-slashing database, whenever used, a web3signer needs to be

* Connected to a storage system (such as a database), and it needs to be ensured that it is always connected.
* Ensured that they are not accidentally terminated.
* Ensured that the failover is using the same web3signer

* [KEC6](#risk-kec-6)
</div>

### Client diversity

Maintain a diverse set of clients for different protocols, in order to reduce blast radius in case one of the clients appears to have a protocol error or other bug. In some cases, migrate keys to different clients in case of a specific client error observed, such as startup issues after controlled update or bug in the latest version of the chosen client.

### Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)

In order to avoid the single-point of failure problem for a node-validator without risking a slashing incident, DVT has been developed.

### Lido-specific: Handling of delinquent state&#x20;

In order to avoid loosing out on opportunity cost, Node operators need to develop and adhere to strict processes to properly exit validators, as they are otherwise put into a delinquent state. This results in monetary losses.

## Secret Management

### Controlled/audited secret access

Any secret needs to be accessed and authorized through a vault system. In this way, everything is audited, and anomaly detection can be activated for those vaults.

Also, multi-sig wallets should be used where appropriate.

Furthermore, access credentials for internal systems should also be stored inside those vaults, and key rotation managed from there.

### Encryption of data at rest/in transit

Many different components interplay while a staking operation is going on. It is crucial, since sensitive information may be transmitted, to ensure that data is stored and transmitted in an encrypted fashion.

### Store withdrawal keys in a cold location

Ideally, since these keys are not used often, it makes sense to store them in locations where data is not as often accessed. Ideally Air-Gapped.

### Employees and signing keys

Employees should not be able to delete signing keys and there should be a back-up for the signing keys. Modern vault systems can have policies where deletion is prevented by certain or all users. Signing keys should be only possible to be removed by the root-user or through some multi-signing mechanism.

<div class="info">
**Links to risks:**

* [KEC10](#risk-kec-10)
</div>

### Access to unencrypted signing keys

The use case where an employee would need to access a signing key is low, and this should only be possible with a clear protocol when a support case is required. Vault systems can be set up that only verifier container roles can access these keys.

<div class="info">
**Links to risks:**

* [KEC2](#risk-kec-2)
* [KEC11](#risk-kec-11)
</div>

### Key rotation

Key rotation and a proper process around it is key to protect one's infrastructure from a potential breach of credentials. When in doubt, keys should be rotated. This includes, but is not limited to:

* The Postgres database used by Web3Signer
* The vault itself
* Any SSH keys
* Any API keys for your cloud infrastructure

## Access Management
@@
### Access controls & access management

Access Control covers at least 3 types of access

- Physical access to devices and facilities
- The ability to connect to software through networks
- Requiring defined authorization to perform any specific task, including getting answers to requests

A core principle to follow in granting authorization is [least privilege](#least-privilege). This is usually achieved by using [role-based access control](#rbac), to grant users specific sets of access permissions as required, that are revoked or explicitly and deliberately renewed as often as possible. These enable specific tasks or responsibilities, with fine-grained roles defined throughout all processes of an organization.

Each user should be assigned roles, and some are temporary. There should be a clear lifetime of a role, that is automatically enforced and can be extended when needed.  On- and off-boarding should be simple, and every piece of the infrastructure should be secured from unauthenticated and unauthorized access.


<div class="info">
**Links to risks:**

* [SLS8](#risk-sls-8)
* [SLS9](#risk-sls-9)
* [DOW16](#risk-dow-16)
* [GIR1](#risk-gir-1)
* [GIR7](#risk-gir-7)
* [GIR22](#risk-gir-22)
</div>


When it comes to access control, there are three pillars that need to be considered:

* Authentication: Ensure that no service accepts requests without some form of authentication.
* Authorization: Clearly define who can read/write/update/delete resources. Ideally, this is not done on a per-user basis, but on a per-role basis.
* Audit: Ensure that all access is logged so that you can alert on anomalies. Especially login failures should be logged.

COSO Principles:
1. Keep an inventory of information assets
2. Restrict Logical Access — Logical access to information assets, should be restricted through the use of access control software and rule sets.
3. Use sufficiently strong authentication systems.
4. Network Segmentation — Restrict access to nodes to a minimum set of IPs.
5. Manage Points of Access — Access to nodes inside the segmented area need to be controlled with authentication and authorization methods.
6. Proper credentials management for infrastructure software — A clear definition of each credential life-time is established and enforced.

COSO principle
//Does this belong in secret maangement?
7. Protects Encryption Keys — Processes are in place to protect encryption keys for their lifetime.

This is covered by [secret management](#secret-management)

Special considerations:

* Disable meta-data serving through public endpoints (like what server is running in what version).
* Limit the outbound traffic of a node that runs a certain service.
* Apply rate limits to ensure that internal services cannot unintentionally DDos each other.
* Where possible apply the use of authentication tokens that have a limited lifetime.



**Examples for best practices:**

* Creation and continuous analysis of Software Bill of Materials ([SBOM](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom)).
* Use of Clients, roles and groups when using [AWS IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-role.html).
* Have an internal virtual private network and only have well-defined endpoints be accessible from the web.
* Uses of vault systems to manage credentials and encryption keys. Like AWS KMS.

### Implement least privilege

The core of <dfn>Least Privilege</dfn> is that access is only granted to those who need it, and only for as long as it is relevant. This means that an individual user's privileges are likely to change over time - and in particular, most or all of them are rapidly revoked during any offboarding process.

Almost all Least Privilege implementation is managed through role-based access control, where a set of roles are defined that are disctinguished by the different tasks they need to perform. Access rights are then based on holding a particular role, with individual users assigned relevant roles that are revoked or deliberately renewed to maintain the

//the following is mostly relevant to RBAC not LP
Main outline from the COSO principles:

1. Creates or Modifies Access — Processes are in place to create or modify access.
2. Quick removal of access when needed
3. Use Role-based access control (RBAC)
4. Review of roles and permissions on a regular basis.

**Examples for best practices:**

* Credentials rotation needs to be in place to ensure that there is no interruption in the service when it is done.
* Off-boarding of a terminated employee should not take more than an hour. Ideally, one would only disable them inside a single-sign-on service such as [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) or [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org).
* Tools need to be in place to analyze the permissions of certain users/programs and determine if these are too wide.
* Use of roles on the API endpoint level to determine the correct authorization.

</div>


#### Examples for best practices:

* [Webserver authentication configuration of Microsoft IIS servers.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/authentication/) Observe how different authentication methods are possible to be set there. `anonymousAuthentication` would allow anyone to access as `anonymous`, which is rarely the intention except for the starting page. `basicAuthentication` is better than nothing, but makes user management not scalable. `clientCertificateMappingAuthentication` and `digestAuthentication` are the better ways to also implement RBAC.

* [GIR9](#risk-gir-9)
</div>


Even when employing RBAC, there are ways to log into containers as users and acquire larger privileges from there. Take `docker exec -uroot` as an example. These mechanisms can be disabled on the orchestration level (and should be).

### Network access to nodes

Following the principle of defense in depth and least privilege, it is important that nodes are not directly accessible without permission, and that they do not leak information to the Web that can help malicious parties gain unauthorized access.

Any web access should be proxied through a load-balancer that has a firewall, and the need for remote access has to be clearly justified.

As well as controlling physical access where possible, it is best practice to ensure that nodes are only responsive through restricted access networks. Further, it is important to ensure the hardware running nodes does not have extraneous software (that can increase the risk of monitoring), does not allow generic probing mechanisms such as open port scans that can help malicious parties learn the topology of target systems,   

<div class="info">
**Links to risks:**

* [SLS12](#risk-sls-12)
</div>

### Strong authentication

Use password policies to ensure that access control mechanisms are sufficiently strong at every layer of the infrastructure (i.e. DUCK123 should never be an allowed password ;-)). When users are authenticating, MFA should be used.

<div class="info">
**Links to risks:**

* [SLS13](#risk-sls-13)
</div>

### Prevent physical access to non-authorized persons

This covers all physical devices that can access the Node, as well as all areas in which such devices are kept, whether "on-premises", distributed, hosted by a third party, or remote mobile devices such as laptops.

* Manage and monitor entry to physical areas and physical access to assets.

Best practice for managing physical access includes ensuring that authorization is granted as necessary, following the principles of [Least Privilege], meaning that some devices are physically segregated in areas where access is determined according to their function. Note that this covers the use of devices authorized to access the networks nodes operate on, and is particularly important for devices authorized to access management and analytical functions of nodes.

Ideally all physical access to premises and facilities is monitored, particularly to deter, and determine whether the facility is subject to, <dfn>piggybacking</dfn>, where an unauthorized entrant is allowed in by someone who has a valid authorization for themselves. However, in the context of remote operators' access through a computer this is particularly challenging in practice.

Piggybacking may occur inadvertently, through politely holding a door for someone without checking that they have current valid authorization to enter, negligently by allowing someone to enter for a legitimate purpose despite that person not having a valid authorization, or maliciously allowing someone to enter knowing that their purpose is nefarious.

In the inadvertent case, relevant mitigations are to ensure all those with authorization understand the necessity to enforce phyiscal access control, and to provide simple and effective ways to check authorization, and to ensure that remote access devices as far as possible are dedicated to the defined purposes rather than authorizing on general-purpose laptops that can be subjected to attacks when being used for a different task such as general email, or playing games.

To minimize negligently allowed access, it is important to ensure that access systems are effectively maintained and managed to ensure there is no good reason to allow an unauthorized person access. This can range from the design of onboarding systems to the effectiveness of internal management feedback systems for discovering unanticipated problems faced by operators.

Best practice is to ensure that physical access is managed by systems that can efficiently enable access to authorised parties (keycards, biometric scanners) and monitor actual access such as visual verification that the authorized party is the one entering.

It is important to log and audit access sufficiently frequently to detect problems - see also [Monitoring](@@).

* Protect against environmental threats and utility failures

Physical devices are subject to physical changes, including environmental issues such as temperature extremes that can cause damage, or utility failures such as power or internet failure.

Mitigation strategies include the use of redundant infrastructure with failure detection and failover systems, from  backup node servers in different geographical locations to backup power supply e.g. through local batteries or power generation. The level of mitigation that is appropriate depends on the level of risk, and the costs of both failure and mitigating failure. These calculations mean economies of scale will enable larger-scale operations to be more robust than smaller ones, for a given price.

It is also important to ensure that facilities have appropriate protection from relevant environmental risks - whether fire, flooding, extremes of temperature or wind or even destructive physical attacks will depend in part on the specific location and nature of the facility.

* Maintain all equipment throughout a defined life-cycle.

//move out of physical access?

The lifecycle of equipment, most particularly node servers and computers used to access and manage them, is a determinant of overall security.

Best practices for lifecycle management include the ability to remotely pause, shut down, and wipe devices clean, although this needs to be considered in the context of the risk of malicious access to those capabilities.

[Monitoring](@@) can also identify specific conditions that adversely affect equipment and suggest that a lifecycle plan needs adjustment - whether writing off equipment destroyed by fire, or increasing preventive maintenance for physical access systems that are being used far in excess of expectations that drove the existing maintenance plan.

## Development and Update Process

### Testing and review of all changes to infrastructure code

Anything on the infrastructure should be captured in a code repository, and changes managed through a versioning system such as Git. No direct push to the main branch should be possible; everything should go through pull requests and review.

All code should go through static and dynamic analysis tools to minimize risk.

There should be custom tests created, and a strict testing policy before pushing to prod needs to be in place.

Ideally, metrics should be used to verify a high degree of testing culture. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Line coverage
* Endpoint coverage
* Accidental human error detection
* Architectural enforcement

### No custom changes to the validator software

Validator software is open source, but in order to ensure that no protocol error occurs, the code should not be touched.

### Sanitize inputs

Unchecked inputs are a major cause for overflow attacks and brute force. Ideally, the load balancer in front of the node filters out all traffic that has too large headers and payloads. Additionally, if JSON payloads are being used, they should be checked to adhere to a certain schema.

<div class="info">
**Links to risks:**

* [GIR8](#risk-gir-8)
</div>

### Use of separate tests and staging environments

This minimizes a potential blast radius. It is important to run any change (even an update of a validator software or Web3Signer) through a test environment first, and then roll it out in a staged fashion. If it causes some slashing event, it is then contained to the few nodes that it was rolled out to.

### Use containerized and orchestrated environments only.

Follow their best practice recommendations. Their mechanisms are more than battle-tested in different environments. Any make-shift approach to do mechanisms such as fail-over by hand should be deemed insecure.

### Automation where possible

Human error is a real threat, and every process should at least follow an automated script that may or not be invoked by a human. The other risk of non-manual steps is the reduction of the risk of exposure of secrets. Everything should be done through pipelines and job-mechanisms (GitHub Actions, Apache Airflow, Apache Nifi)

Analyzing images for potential CVEs is simple nowadays (use e.g. [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)). Further configurations inside these images can be checked using [CoGuard](https://www.coguard.io). Any image used in your infrastructure should be checked this way.

## Monitoring and Alerting

Leverage monitoring dashboards or systems to identify risks and gain relevant data.

Monitoring is present in almost all compliance and security frameworks.

It is crucial that not only high level business functions are monitored, but also correct functionality of all containers. In particular, proper log collection allows to dynamically verify that e.g. a slashing database ist actually being used, and used by the right signer.

Main outline from the COSO principles:

* Implements Detection Policies, Procedures, and Tools
* Design and improve on Detection Measures — Ideally capture unauthorized access, suspicios traffic, etc.
* Implement filters to not even let suspicious requests contact the back-end.
* Check frequently if detection tools are working correctly.
* Have one or more centralized dashboards to aggregate the data and present it in a digestible way to a human observer.


### Beacon Chain Monitoring

* **Slashing Events:** Monitor the beacon chain for any slashing events.
* **Anti-Slashing Database:** Regularly poll the local node to ensure the anti-slashing database is enabled and functioning correctly.
* **Impact of Slashing:** Assess and monitor the broader impact of any slashing incidents on the network.
* **Relay List Monitoring:** Monitor the relay list for availability metrics and load balance capabilities between various relayers for downtime conditions.
* **Chain Reorganizations:** Track events and causes of chain reorganizations&#x20;
* **Non-finalized Events:** Monitor events preventing the consensus layer from confirming finality
* **Special Software Conditions:** Monitor major software upgrades requiring specific durations and   events that will conclude the upgrade

### Node and System Health

* **Node Health Metrics:** Monitor key metrics like CPU, memory, restarts, and uptime of nodes.
* **System Configuration:** Monitor system configuration settings in real-time and continuously.
* **Key Usages:** Track the usage of critical system keys.
* **App-specific:** App specific metrics  (e.g. metrics for Dirk & Vouch)

### Security and Compliance

* **Access Control and Logs:** Keep an eye on access controls to nodes and abnormal configuration changes.
* **Phishing and Endpoint Protection:** Monitor for phishing attacks and ensure the security of endpoint protection systems, both for employee devices and infrastructure nodes.
* **Bastion Nodes:** If applicable, monitor bastion or connection nodes.
* **Suspicious Internal Interactions:** Watch for any suspicious internal interactions with infrastructure, cloud security platforms, or network monitoring solutions.
* **Access Patterns and Configurations:** Check for unusual access patterns and the configurations of VPNs and 2FA systems.
* **Relay Compliance:** Monitor relay compliance aspects and availability metrics.

### Upgrade and Code Management

* **Upgrade Process:** Monitor the upgrade process, including client code source, notification channels, bug reports, and community disclosures.
* **Customized Code in Testnet:** Monitor any new custom code deployed in the testnet.

### Hardware and Network

* **Baremetal and Network Equipment Health:** Monitor the health of bare metals and networking equipment, including internet and peering connectivity.
* **Predictive Models:** Use predictive models for future malfunctions and equipment replacement needs.
* **Capacity and Resource Usage:** Track capacity usage, processing memory, and CPU.
* **Peering Connectivity:** Monitor both internal and external network peering connectivity.
* **Firewall Configuration and Metrics:** Keep an eye on firewall configuration changes or unexpected increases in drop metrics.

### Cloud and Infrastructure

* **Cloud Monitoring Solutions:** Utilize cloud monitoring solutions to keep track of uptime and internal issues.
* **Cloud Service Notifications:** Stay informed about cloud service announcements regarding expected downtime and maintenance.

### Logging/Alerting at all levels of the infrastructure

Every component of your node operation is producing logs. These should be captured, analyzed, and alert systems should be set up to warn if something is wrong. Examples include, but are not limited to:

* Web3Signer database has no CRUD operations going on (is it connected?)
* CPU/Memory spike suddenly in container
* Network traffic in and out of container
* Relays
* Slashing related logs on validator nodes

The alert systems should be automatically set up to take actions such as shutting nodes down (nuking).

<div class="info">
Take a look at [collection-of-tools-scripts-and-templates.md](../mitigation-and-controls-library/collection-of-tools-scripts-and-templates.md "mention") for tool examples to perform the monitoring of some of the metrics mentioned above.

### Authentication required for services

All requests for services REQUIRE appropriate authentication

For example, a Node does not respond to anonymous requests on any port.

@@ link to relevant mitigation(s)

### Access to Nodes limited by Network

Nodes MUST NOT respond to requests from outside a defined network.

### Access to server rooms is limited

Entry to physical server locations MUST require authorization

For example, a biometric scan or the use of a keycard.

### Access to server rooms is verified

Entry to physical server locations MUST be reviewed periodically

For example, comparing the number of people entering with the number of authorizations logged, or checking that the person who entered coresponds to the authorization used.

### Server-side request forgery mitigations

An often overlooked aspect of attack vectors is server-side request forgery. In essence, an attacker sends (almost) random messages to the server and analyzes the response. Based on that, they are able to deduce behavioral patterns that can be used for a successful attack.

The most common goal of such attacks is to create some form of an overflow. Modern load-balancers and web-servers have built-in functionality that serve as a first line of defense against such mechanisms.

Functionality to look out for when creating your application is:

* Validate the user input against a given schema where possible.
* Limit the request size that the server accepts. This includes payload and header.
* Do not use redirections or symbolic links unless absolutely necessary.
* Use rate limits to make this attack infeasible.
* When writing user-input into a database, always use Object Relational Mappers to achieve maximal protection against SQL injection.

**References:**

* [OWASP A10:2021: Server Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_\(SSRF\)/)

**Examples for best practices:**

* ORM systems exist for almost all programming languages and frameworks. Some of the most common ones are [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/getting-started/), [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io) and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org).
* In the Apache web-server, one can control the request size of different pieces of the request:
  * [LimitRequestBody](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody)
  * [LimitRequestFields](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#limitrequestfields)
* In order to protect oneself from bad redirects, one can define proper [[CORS](#cors)] headers and a ContentSecurityPolicy[[CSP](#csp)]. Both are set in header fileds of your Web server or load balancer.

## SOC 2

### Control activities to achieve operational goals

In a nutshell: technology needs to serve the business goal, not the other way around.

Main outline from the COSO principles:

1. **Technology Infrastructure Control** — Stakeholders develop control activities over the technology infrastructure, ensuring accuracy, availability and completeness of data.
2. **Security Access Control** — External threats are analyzed and access rights are properly defined.
3. **Third Party tool integration** — Integration, management, and updates of third party tools is closely monitored.

**References:**

* CC 5.2 of the Trust Services Criteria

**Examples for best practices:**

* Every third party software that is brought in needs to be known, and proper change management applied to it.
* Every third party software needs to be analyzed for the correct access rights with respect to users who can access it, but also the privileges it needs on the system it runs on. \
  Examples for this are:
  * Do not run main processes as root, since a compromised software can then execute privileged operations.
  * Do not allow uncontrolled inbound and outbound networking traffic to this specific service.

### Risk assessment of one's own Node operation

Node operation does not equal node operation. There are subjective goals for each organization, and the way they decided to operate. This control ensures that one is always having an eye on risk assessments.

Main outline from the COSO principles:

1. Considers Tolerances for Risk — Identify what is acceptable.
2. Complies With Externally Established Frameworks — Consider local and international laws and benchmarks when developing the node operation.

**References:**

* CC 3.1 of the Trust Services Criteria

**Examples for best practices:**

* Ensure that every service, where possible, is configuration hardened using common benchmarks such as [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org).
* Analyze each component in your infrastructure environment in terms of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy.
* Outline directly which risks are a high priority, and which ones are more acceptable, and the scenarios where it applies. For example, downtime comes only with an opportunity cost for ETH stakers, but may cause a slashing event in Polkadot.

### Protection of Data in transit

Data remains rarely in one place. It is accessed, displayed, and analyzed. For each such operation, it needs to be ensured that there is no weakest link in the chain, and that any data in transit is protected as well.

Main outline from the COSO principles:

* Transmission of sensitive data needs to be restricted.
* Data in transit needs to be encrypted.

**References:**

* CC 6.7 of the trust services criteria

**Examples for best practices:**

* Ensuring that encrypted communication is enabled for each service. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Databases
  * Web servers
  * Streaming services
  * Load balancers
  * Authentication systems
  * CI/CD pipeline tools
* Ensure that the latest version of TLS is being used, in combination with [secure algorithms](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4).

* When possible, determine the root cause.
* Implement necessary changes to prevent similar disasters.
* Implements Incident-Recovery Plan Testing periodically.

**References:**

### Proper change management

This is challenging for classically set up IT operations, but is straightforward if modern Infrastructure as Code principles are being used.

Main outline from the COSO principles:

* Manages Changes Throughout the System Life Cycle — To support system availability and processing integrity, any changes need to go through a well-defined process.
* Only perform authorized changes.
* Use a version control system for infrastructure.
* Maintain configuration of software in a code-base.
* Tests are in place for system changes.

* Have breaking-glass change mechanisms in place for emergency situations.
* Protect confidential information to be leaked or accidentally accessed in the change management system.

**References:**

* CC 8.1 of the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

**Examples for best practices:**

* While this seems like a lot of points, most of them can be addressed by following the [GitOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/#what-is-git-ops) to infrastructure.

## Communications Strategy

## Stakeholder Overview

### 🙂 Known Stakeholders

This type of stakeholders discloses the identity and provides contact details and channels for communication. Direct and close communication can be required.

#### **Institutional Stakers**

* High stake investors with potential of contractual obligations
* Generally require close contact and channels for direct contact

#### **Service Partners**

* Partners (e.g. Lido) operating and managing protocols and their respective Node Operator landscape and requiring governance votes
* Generally require close contact and channels for direct contact
* Emergency communication in case of incident

#### **Infrastructure Partners**

* Partners involved in hosting, managing or operating infrastructure as part of the node operation setup
* Need direct contact in case of emergency measure

#### **Media**

* Media channels, platforms, and accounts covering technical and non-technical news and reports
* Need for monitoring of business relevant news
* Need for close monitoring and engagement in case of incidents with business impact and public awareness

#### **Core & Client Dev Teams**

* Teams developing and maintaining critical node operations software
* Need for communication channel in case updates, maintenance and information around critical software components, especially in the event of software issues

#### Other Node Operators

* Node Operators running validators and similar tech stack
* Need for close monitoring of communication channels and alerting in case of published incidents with potential relevance for own setup

#### **Optional: Service Customers**

* Individuals or organizations using additional service provided by Node Operators (e.g., API users, customers for white-label solutions etc.)
* Need for direct customer service contact
* Need for information & updates in case of incidents

### 🫥 Mixed Stakeholders

This type of stakeholders cover entities that do not necessarily disclose their identity information nor provide channels of contact to Node Operators. They might follow available public channels such as X(Twitter), Discord, or public Telegram groups but can also exists entirely independent.

#### **Individual Stakers**

* Low stake investors
* Need for communication of status and incident updates across all public channels

#### **Communities**

* Individuals or organizations with diverse motivations (e.g., lobbyism, issues, questions, feedback, etc.)
* Need for public and anonymous communication platform

### Ecosystem Touchpoints

Below you can find common channels and means of contacts used by Node Operators to enable tailored communications across the diverse types of stakeholders.

{% hint style="info" %}
Stakeholders highly individual and therefore preferences for communication channels can differ. These individual channel preferences need to be identified in advance.

### Stakeholder Management

#### General Procedures

The following procedures shall ensure appropriate consideration and management of relevant stakeholders:

1. Define all stakeholders that are relevant to your organization \
   (Reference: [stakeholder-overview.md](stakeholder-overview.md "mention"))
2. Define and align communciation channels that you intend to use for engagement with your stakeholders \
   (Reference: [ecosystem-touchpoints.md](ecosystem-touchpoints.md "mention"))
3. Perform a stakeholder mapping and define your individual ways of engagement with the different stakeholder groups (Reference: [#stakeholder-map](stakeholder-management.md#stakeholder-map "mention"))
4. Document all defined stakeholders with the respective management measures in the stakeholder register (Reference: [#stakeholder-register](stakeholder-management.md#stakeholder-register "mention")). Also take best practices covering incident communication into account (Reference: [incident-communication-protocols.md](../incident-communication-protocols.md "mention")).
5. Define appropriate intervals to review accuracy and relevance of documented contents in the stakeholder register

#### Stakeholder Map

The **Stakeholder Map** provides guidance when categorizing the individual stakeholders into different communication groups. It can be used as an initial assessment for further review and adaption to your individual stakeholder landscape.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only use the Communication Map below as a reference! Review each your stakeholder individually and assess needed means of contact! You can find the template here: [stakeholder-map.md](../templates-and-toolkits/stakeholder-map.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Stakeholder_Map (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Stakeholder Map</p></figcaption></figure>

##### **Manage Closely**

* Establish direct communication channels (e.g., Telegram, Slack or similar)
* Individual status reporting and communications
* Perform immediate alignment in case of incidents

##### **Keep Satisfied**

* Establish public communication channels (e.g., Telegram, Discord, X)
* Regular status reporting and engagement
* Provide summary and updates in case of incidents

##### **Keep Informed**

* Establish direct or public communication channels depending on need for responsiveness (e.g., Mail, Discord, Telegram, Slack, X)
* Provide summary and updates in case of incidents

##### **Monitor**

* Monitor activities and react to activities and requests

#### Stakeholder Register

The **Stakeholder Register** is a key management document, listing all stakeholders with details about their roles, interests, and impact on the organization. It is essential for understanding and managing stakeholders, ensuring tailored and effective communication.

### Incident Communication Protocols

Incidents can lead to a massive impact on Node Operators and their stakeholders. They can result in far more than only direct financial losses but also in irreversible reputational and collateral damages. In order to minimize incident impacts and ensure effective analysis and communications, the standardized communication protocols in this section give a reference for relevant procedures.&#x20;

The **Incident Communication Protocols** equip Node Operators with guidelines around predefined procedures that cover both internal and external procedures.&#x20;

#### Internal Procedures

##### 📋 Pre-Incident

1. Define relevant internal teams and stakeholders for specific incidents in the respective Incident Response Plan (see [risk-management-procedures.md](../risk-framework/risk-management-procedures.md "mention"))
2. Define dedicated channels of communication in the case of an incident

##### 🚨 During Incident

1. Create an incident async communication channel (Slack, Telegram, or similar).
2. Initiate defined procedures in respective Incident Response Plan.
3. Investigate the specific incident if the root cause is not clear:

* Escalate to relevant team (based on the specific risk).
* Collect generic data about the incident from the detection/monitoring system or the infrastructure.
* Have “Involved teams” in Incident Response Plan depending on the triaged risk and invite the relevant stakeholders in the order defined.

4. Collect data and create documentation for:

* Executive summary and communication procedures
* Technical details and sync of team members as the incident progresses
* Optional: Incident response platform can be used to do that in a more efficient manner&#x20;

5. Create a communication matrix what should or should not be communicated and the communication of information to departments inside the organization.

##### 🔎 Post-Incident

1. Create internal post-incident summaries.
2. Create summaries for executives and communications with next steps.
3. Apply new monitoring and detection to limit future risk exposures.
4. Perform extensive post-mortem analysis (see [post-mortem-analysis.md](templates-and-toolkits/post-mortem-analysis.md "mention")).

#### External Procedures

##### 📋 Pre-Incident

* Define relevant external stakeholders for specific incidents in the respective Incident Response Plan
* Define dedicated channels of communication in the case of an incident

##### 🚨 During Incident

1. Involve relevant teams of legal, privacy, policy, and communication departments (if applicable).
2. Update executive and internal teams before any external communication.
3. Ensure to communicate only when things are certain and clear 100%.
4. Handle the sharing of information based on the respective incident response plan.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** Communicating as an incident is ongoing can result in further damage, only communicating about the root cause when it is identified and potentially resolved on a case-by-case basis.
{% endhint %}

##### 🔎 Post-Incident

1. Decide on information and level of detail of the post-mortem analysis (see [post-mortem-analysis.md](templates-and-toolkits/post-mortem-analysis.md "mention")) to be shared with the different stakeholders ([stakeholder-management.md](stakeholder-strategy/stakeholder-management.md "mention")) across the communication channels.
