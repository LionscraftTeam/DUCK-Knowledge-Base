Slashing Risks:

<table><thead><tr><th width="96">ID</th><th width="138">Risk Group</th><th width="232">Risk Vectors</th><th>Risk Vector Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SLS1</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Operational Failure: Single validator signs two different blocks</td><td>Single node signs two different blocks, e.g. failure in setting up the anti-slashing mechanism (e.g. no lokal anti-slashing database disabled or deleted) or failure in the validator migration process.</td></tr><tr><td>SLS2</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Operational Failure: Shutting down validator only temporarily</td><td>Validator shuts (temporary) down. System spins up a new validator with the same key</td></tr><tr><td>SLS3</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Operational Failure: Validator keys are used on 2 different validators</td><td>System takes the same keys twice from the key database and deploys them on two different validators.</td></tr><tr><td>SLS4</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Operational Failure: Failure in setting up the anti-slashing mechanisms correctly</td><td>Failure in setting up the anti-slashing mechanisms correctly (e.g. Web3Signer has no slashing protection enabled, no database, database only in memory and not on disk, 2 or several copies of Web3Signer, slashing databse can be deleted)</td></tr><tr><td>SLS5</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Double key usage in the CI/CD pipeline</td><td>Usage of same key within different environments causing a slashing</td></tr><tr><td>SLS6</td><td>Software</td><td>Software Bug (e.g. Validator Client) (Intentional or accidentional) through update</td><td>New versions of a validator client that may cause errors that lead to slashing<br>Supply chain attack</td></tr><tr><td>SLS7</td><td>Software</td><td>Software Bug (e.g. Validator Client) through software customization</td><td><br>New versions of a validator client may cause errors that lead to slashing</td></tr><tr><td>SLS8</td><td>People</td><td>Malicious Internal Employee intentionally causes operational failure via his given user rights</td><td>Anything that an internal employee has access to is at risk of being exploited to sabotage the operation resulting in a slashing incident.</td></tr><tr><td>SLS9</td><td>People</td><td>Malicious Internal Employee intentionally causes operational failure via privilege escalation</td><td>A malicious internal employee can get additional rights via through privileges escalation.</td></tr><tr><td>SLS10</td><td>People</td><td>Malicious Ex-Employee intentionally causes a slashing incident</td><td>A Ex-Employee can still have access to the system when his acces is not blocked or removed</td></tr><tr><td>SLS11</td><td>People</td><td>Malicious External Hacker intentionally causes slashing incident</td><td>Malicious External Hacker gets system access through absence of or weak cyber security standards</td></tr><tr><td>SLS12</td><td>People</td><td>Malicious External Hacker intentionally causes slashing incident</td><td>Malicious External Hacker gets external network access to the system</td></tr><tr><td>SLS13</td><td>People</td><td>Malicious External Hacker intentionally causes operational failure through authentication access</td><td>Malicious External Hacker can get access through by-passing or brut-forcing authentication systems</td></tr><tr><td>SLS14</td><td>Process</td><td>Operational Failure: Incorrect implementation of the failover mechanism: Failover system comes unexpectedly online</td><td>If the failover does not ensure that old system is not still alive in some way or is using a stale version of the anti-slashing database, e.g.: failover system starts accidentally although primary system is not down</td></tr><tr><td>SLS15</td><td>Process</td><td>Operational Failure: Incorrect implementation of the failover mechanism: Primary system comes unexpectedly back online</td><td>If the failover does not ensure that old system is not still alive in some way or is using a stale version of the anti-slashing database, e.g.: failover system starts (manually / automatically) because primary system is down and primary system comes back online</td></tr><tr><td>SLS16</td><td>Process</td><td>Operational Failure: Slashing monitoring does not prevent system shut down</td><td>Slashing events keep ongoing on because no slashing monitoring system in place</td></tr><tr><td>SLS17</td><td>Process</td><td>Operational Failure: Slashing monitoring ignores alerts</td><td>Monitoring is in place, but slashing events keep ongoing on because alerts are not monitored</td></tr><tr><td>SLS18</td><td>Process</td><td>Operational Failure: Slashing monitoring does not shut down the validators</td><td>Slashing keeps going on because system fails to automatically shut down after alerts</td></tr></tbody></table>
