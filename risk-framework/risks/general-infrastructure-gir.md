General infrastructure risks:

<table><thead><tr><th width="98">ID</th><th width="144">Risk Group</th><th>Risk Vectors</th><th>Risk Vector Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GIR1</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Not granular enough role-definitions for access control</td><td>Internal employees and external hackers may gain access to too many systems if they manage to have a highly privileged role</td></tr><tr><td>GIR2</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Token lifetimes are too wide</td><td>Authentication information does not expire timely and can be used later.</td></tr><tr><td>GIR3</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Fix versions on every deploy</td><td>Downtime if a system needs to be just re-started if newest version is accidentally pulled</td></tr><tr><td>GIR4</td><td>Process</td><td>Insufficient monitoring/logging</td><td>- Inability to learn from incidents<br>- Late detection of incidents<br>- insufficient automation to react to incidents</td></tr><tr><td>GIR5</td><td>Process</td><td>Insufficient off-boarding controls, e.g. by too many authentication mechanisms around.</td><td>terminated employee can remain having access to systems and do harm</td></tr><tr><td>GIR6</td><td>Process</td><td>No password rotation</td><td>- Leak of passwords<br>- brute force</td></tr><tr><td>GIR7</td><td>Process</td><td>Use of direct auth</td><td>Authentication information does not expire timely and can be used later.</td></tr><tr><td>GIR8</td><td>Process</td><td>No Input validation</td><td>Buffer overflow attacks</td></tr><tr><td>GIR9</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Failure to properly perform network segmentation</td><td>No container/node should be openly accessible from the internet from all IP addresses. This increases the attack vector enormously</td></tr><tr><td>GIR10</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Lack of encrypted traffic between services and deployment scripts</td><td>Anyone on the network can sniff out packages with secrets included, and may be able to steal passwords and tokens in this way</td></tr><tr><td>GIR11</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>No separate tests and staging environments</td><td>Improper change management and testing of software updates "in production"</td></tr><tr><td>GIR12</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>General architectural flaws</td><td>General risk category that can cause downtime, slashing, etc.<br>This includes, but is not limited to:<br>- Non-scalable deployments<br>- Use of tools not made for this purpose<br>- Lack of robustness/redundancy<br>- Bad change management<br>- Bad container isolation</td></tr><tr><td>GIR13</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>High Blast radius of software bug in overall system</td><td>A small error affects the whole system and all clients right away, instead of being caught early with limited effect on the whole system.</td></tr><tr><td>GIR14</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Low Infrastructure provider security</td><td>Hacks through the apis of the infrastructure provider</td></tr><tr><td>GIR15</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>CVE Monitoring</td><td>Attack on the system suddenly possible once published</td></tr><tr><td>GIR16</td><td>People</td><td>Human error</td><td>Anything a human can touch can go wrong</td></tr><tr><td>GIR17</td><td>Process</td><td>Use of non-hardened images</td><td>Attack on the system using the weakest link of a given node/container</td></tr><tr><td>GIR18</td><td>Process</td><td>Insufficient change management mechanisms in place</td><td>- Downtime on update<br>- Slow down in reaction time to incident</td></tr><tr><td>GIR19</td><td>Process</td><td>Lack of automation for deloyment</td><td>- Downtime on update<br>- Slow down in reaction time to incident</td></tr><tr><td>GIR20</td><td>Process</td><td>Lack of testing (software and infrastructure)</td><td>- Downtime on update<br>- Slow down in reaction time to incident</td></tr><tr><td>GIR21</td><td>Process</td><td>Lack of enforced code review</td><td>- Downtime on update<br>- Slow down in reaction time to incident</td></tr><tr><td>GIR22</td><td>Process</td><td>Lack of Security training (password hygiene, phising attacks, ...)</td><td>Employees spill secrets</td></tr><tr><td>GIR23</td><td>Process</td><td>Make-shift container orchestration procedures</td><td>Failure when e.g. failover is actually needed to be performed</td></tr><tr><td>GIR24</td><td>Software</td><td>Third party software and vendors</td><td>Suboptimal third-party software practices</td></tr></tbody></table>
