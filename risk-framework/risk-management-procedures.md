# Risk Management Procedures

Processes and actions that should be defined to address risks and that cover the concrete procedures in case of related incidents. &#x20;

## 1. Risk Monitoring

Leverage monitoring dashboards or systems to identify the risk and gain relevant data.

### Beacon Chain Monitoring

* **Slashing Events:** Monitor the beacon chain for any slashing events.
* **Anti-Slashing Database:** Regularly poll the local node to ensure the anti-slashing database is enabled and functioning correctly.
* **Impact of Slashing:** Assess and monitor the broader impact of any slashing incidents on the network.

### Node and System Health

* **Node Health Metrics:** Monitor key metrics like CPU, memory, restarts, and uptime of nodes.
* **System Configuration:** Monitor system configuration settings in real-time and continuously.
* **Key Usages:** Track the usage of critical system keys.

### Security and Compliance

* **Access Control and Logs:** Keep an eye on access controls to nodes and abnormal configuration changes.
* **Phishing and Endpoint Protection:** Monitor for phishing attacks and ensure the security of endpoint protection systems, both for employee devices and infrastructure nodes.
* **Bastion Nodes:** If applicable, monitor bastion or connection nodes.
* **Suspicious Internal Interactions:** Watch for any suspicious internal interactions with infrastructure, cloud security platforms, or network monitoring solutions.
* **Access Patterns and Configurations:** Check for unusual access patterns and the configurations of VPNs and 2FA systems.
* **Relay Compliance:** Monitor relay compliance aspects and availability metrics.

### Upgrade and Code Management

* **Upgrade Process:** Monitor the upgrade process, including client code source, notification channels, bug reports, and community disclosures.
* **Customized Code in Testnet:** Monitor any new custom code deployed in the testnet.

### Hardware and Network

* **Baremetal and Network Equipment Health:** Monitor the health of bare metals and networking equipment, including internet and peering connectivity.
* **Predictive Models:** Use predictive models for future malfunctions and equipment replacement needs.
* **Capacity and Resource Usage:** Track capacity usage, processing memory, and CPU.
* **Peering Connectivity:** Monitor both internal and external network peering connectivity.
* **Firewall Configuration and Metrics:** Keep an eye on firewall configuration changes or unexpected increases in drop metrics.

### Cloud and Infrastructure

* **Cloud Monitoring Solutions:** Utilize cloud monitoring solutions to keep track of uptime and internal issues.
* **Cloud Service Notifications:** Stay informed about cloud service announcements regarding expected downtime and maintenance.

### Legal and Compliance Aspects

* **Relay List Monitoring:** Monitor the relay list for availability metrics and load balance capabilities between various relayers for downtime conditions.
* **Slashing Database for Extreme Changes:** Be alert for any extreme changes in the slashing database.

## 2. Incident Response Plan

Define Incident Response Plans specific for every risk.

{% endhint %}

* Define which data to collect for monitoring purposes
* How to report risk between teams
* Provide a severity tag to an incident based on the specific risk, exposure, and mitigation options
* Describe the relevant people and order of involvement in case of an incident

## 3. Pre-Mortem

Perform Pre-Mortems for specific risks. The article linked below provides instructions on how to use Pre-Mortems to prevent problems, blunders, and disasters.
