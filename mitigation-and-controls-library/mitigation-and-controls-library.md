# ℹ️ Mitigation & Controls Library

The Mitigations & Controls Library is a curated repository of information, tools, and best practices designed to address and manage risks inherent to node operations. This comprehensive library serves as a go-to resource for node operators, providing actionable insights and mitigation options to enhance the security, reliability, and efficiency of their operations.

Tangible components:

* Mitigation strategies and Best Practices
* Controls catalog
* Implementation Guides library for selected controls
* Ready-to-use tools, scripts, and templates

Most of the best practices that optimize up-time, access control and general stability directly apply to operating a node properly. However, there are a few risks that are very specific to running a node-operator, and to mitigate them, higher levels of process segregation need to be achieved.

When analyzing the scope and the respective identified risks, we have found the best fit being a combination of control criteria from three frameworks:

* [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
* [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001)
* [AICPA SOC2 Trust Services criteria](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/2017-trust-services-criteria-with-revised-points-of-focus-2022)

As with every audit, we put together the control criteria which are [material](https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c-00320.pdf) in the context of protecting node operators from their specific risks.
