# Introduction

## What is ValOS?

ValOS describes risks that Node Operators face, mitigation strategies, how to assess whether the risks are adequately managed by a Node Operator.

ValOS is the next stage evolution of the [D.U.C.K Knowledge Base](https://duck-initiative.gitbook.io/d.u.c.k.-knowledge-base),
bringing the core content together in a specification that is updated and maintained through a transparent process
to make it easier to understand what needs to be done and how to test whether it is, with a less flippant name.

The primary objective is to bootstrap and facilitate community engagement with information about node operator excellence.

We encourage the community to use, review, and contribute to the content.

By disseminating and providing easy access to this knowledge, we empower the node operator community to increase robustness.
ValOS enables all operators to engage with a wealth of information, experiences, and methodologies
that they can adapt and customize to their own specific service model.

## Why is ValOS relevant?

Ethereum’s staking ecosystem is powered by the ever-expanding set of node operators. Each operator, with its unique operational methodology, contributes to the protocol’s strength and resilience. This diversity of processes, tools, systems, and geographies within the group of operators should be further nurtured and promoted.

With expected growth in the operator set, each with different team structures and sizes, global footprints, and operational complexities, collaborative and cooperative mechanisms should be devised. They should enable operators to effectively grasp crucial insights on risk management and mitigation,
and to understand what an auditor will be checking for when they are assessing a Node Operator against the ValOS framework.

## Updates

ValOS is being revised over the course of 2025 with a new version expected before the end of the year.
