## What is D.U.C.K.?

The initiative DUCK, "**D**istributed **U**tilization of **C**onfigurations and **K**nowledge", has the goal to equip  node operators with open-source resources enhancing operations and mitigating risks in running staking infrastructure. Through the [Risk Framework](risk-framework/risk-framework.md), [Mitigation & Controls Library](mitigation-and-controls-library/mitigation-and-controls-library), and the [Communications Toolkit](communications-toolkit/communications-toolkit), Node Operators have access to assets that they can customize based on their own unique setup and operations.

## Why is D.U.C.K relevant?

Ethereumâ€™s staking ecosystem is powered by the ever-expanding set of node operators. Each operator, with its unique operational methodology, contributes to the protocolâ€™s strength and resilience. This diversity of processes, tools, systems, and geographies within the group of operators should be further nurtured and promoted.

With expected growth in the operator set, each with different team structures and sizes, global footprints, and operational complexities, collaborative and cooperative mechanisms should be devised. They should enable operators to effectively grasp crucial insights on risk management and mitigation, control measures, and operational best practices.

## What is the objective of D.U.C.K.?

The primary objective of DUCK is to bootstrap and facilitate community engagement with respect to information around node operator excellence. The community shall be encouraged to meaningfully contribute to the content and to engage in self-regulation when it comes to the utilization and review of these resources.

By disseminating and providing easy access to this knowledge, the node operator community will be empowered to increase robustness. It will ensure that all operators, irrespective of their technical proficiency, can engage with a wealth of information, experiences, and methodologies to adapt and customize to their own specific service model.&#x20;

## Updating D.U.C.K.

The knowledge base is being revised over the course of 2025, to help make it more actionable.
